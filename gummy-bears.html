  <h2>Gummy Bears</h2>

  <p>A recipe for some delicious, homemade gummy bears.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
    <li>Sorbitol</li>
    <li>Corn Syrup</li>
    <li>Water or Juice</li>
    <li>KNOX Gelatin</li>
    <li>Citric Acid</li>
    <li>Candy Flavoring</li>
    <li>Food Coloring</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Combine gelatin, and water (or flavored liquid) in a heatproof container. Stir gently to combine. Let sit for 5
      minutes to give your gelatin time to bloom.</li>
    <li>Combine together the corn syrup, sugar, and sorbitol in a medium saucepan. Stir gently to combine. Bring to a
      simmer over medium-high heat. </li>
    <li>Once simmering, wash down the side of the pan with water using a clean pastry brush to make sure any stray
      grains of sugar is dissolved fully.</li>
    <li>Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in your citric acid and gelatin mixture with a spatula until gelatin
      is melted.</li>
    <li>Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes and allow the mixture to clear and foam to collect at the top. After 10
      minutes the foam should be able to be easily scooped off the surface with a spoon.</li>
    <li>Divide your mixture by straining the liquid into three bowls and add in any coloring or candy flavorings that
      you want.</li>
    <li>Spray your molds lightly with some oil and wipe out the excess. Pour your mixture into your molds.</li>
    <li>Let your gummy bears chill in the fridge for 6 hours until the bears are set but 24 hours is best. Once they are
      set they can be stored at room temperature.</li>
  </ol>
