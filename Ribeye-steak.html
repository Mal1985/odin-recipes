  <p>A recipe for a juicy, flavorful ribeye.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Ribeye Steaks</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black Pepper</li>
    <li>White Pepper</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Remove <strong>2 (10-12 ounce) ribeye steaks</strong> from the refridgerator and any packaging and let sit at
      room temperature for at least 30 minites, or up to 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Rub each side with <strong>2 teaspoons olive oil</strong> to coat. In a small bowl stir together <strong>1
        teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper,</strong> and <strong>1/2 teaspoon white pepper.</strong> Rub both
      sides of each steak with the rub mixture.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahreinheit. Heat a heavy, oveb-safe skillet over high heat until it is smoking
      hot. Sear steaks in the hot pan for 2-3 minutes per side until there is lots of golden browning on the surface.
      If the steak has a side of fat, use tongs tomturn the steak onto its side and render the fat by searing it for
      2-3 minutes as well.</li>
    <li>Slide the skillet with the seared steaks in it into the oven to finish cooking. Remove the steaks from the
      oven 5 degrees before the desired level of doneness is achieved, or 130 degrees Faranheit, for medium. Use a
      meat thermometer to ensure accuracy.</li>
    <li>When the steaks are removed from the oven immediately top with 1 tablespoon on each steak of <strong>2
        tablespoons resting butter</strong> and allow the steaks to rest 10 minutes before cutting into them. The
      temperature of the steak will continue to rise as it rests by about 5 degrees.</li>
  </ol>
